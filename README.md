# Stopwatch with React

Following [this article](https://dev.to/abdulbasit313/how-to-develop-a-stopwatch-in-react-js-with-custom-hook-561b) I made a stopwatch with react using custom hook  in one branch and redux in another one. I added to the project in the article partial timestamps so the implementation with redux was more interesting.

## Goals

* useRef hook
* implement and undertand custom hooks (branch custom-hook)
* review redux implementation and side-effects in slices
